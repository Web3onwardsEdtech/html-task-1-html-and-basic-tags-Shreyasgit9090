      <h1>Hello, I'm Shreyas S G</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my profile section</p>
      <p>
        I'm a web developer from MSRIT currently studying in my 4th semester ISE. I have good knowledge in creating modern, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recently participated in a 8 hour college hackathon where me and my team were able to create a website named AgroAssist for farmers helping with their requirements.

        I'm passionate about full-stack development and love collaborating on creative and meaningful projects. Whether it's building websites or solving real-world problems with code, I'm always excited to learn and grow. Currently I have cleared my interview round with Web3Onwards and looking forward to work as team and build some great stuff!
